# Going the Distance

When I was a kid, I used to sit in awe watching the Rocky movies. One moment that stuck with me is when Rocky says he doesnâ€™t care about winning or being the championâ€”he just wants to go the distance, to prove to himself that heâ€™s no bum. I relate to that deeply.

This repository is filled with _my_ solutions to the algomap.io roadmap. Iâ€™m not here to claim Iâ€™m the best coder. **I just want to go the distance.**
