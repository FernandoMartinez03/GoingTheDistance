When I was a kid, I used to sit in awe while watching the Rocky movies. One moment that has struck with me particularly is Rocky saying that he doesn't want to win--he doesn't want to be the champion. He just wants to go the distance. Prove to himself that "he's no bum". I think this is something I relate to strongly. This repository will be filled with MY solutions to the algomap.io roadmap. I don't pretend to be the number one coding. I just want to go the distance.
