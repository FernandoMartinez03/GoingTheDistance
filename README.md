# Going the Distance

When I was a kid, I used to sit in awe watching the Rocky movies. One moment that stuck with me is when Rocky says he doesn’t care about winning or being the champion—he just wants to go the distance, to prove to himself that he’s no bum. I relate to that deeply.

This repository is filled with _my_ solutions to the algomap.io roadmap. I’m not here to claim I’m the best coder. **I just want to go the distance.**
