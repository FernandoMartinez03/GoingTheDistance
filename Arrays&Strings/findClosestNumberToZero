"""
Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums. 
If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.

Input: nums = [2,-1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.

NOTES: Not much to say, iterate the list one at a time and compare. O(n) time complexity. REMEMBER to take into consideration float("inf") and float("-inf").
